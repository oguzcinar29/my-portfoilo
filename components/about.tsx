        I'm OÄŸuz, a former student of electrical engineering who discovered a
        passion for programming while studying. My journey began with learning C
        and C++ during my time in university, where I found immense joy in
        software development. Subsequently, I made the bold decision to
        transition into the web development sphere, which led me to depart from
        my university education. In pursuit of becoming a proficient web
        developer, I devoted myself to self-directed learning and skill
        enhancement. Through various Udemy courses and acquiring certifications,
        I deepened my understanding of web technologies. I supplemented
        theoretical knowledge with practical application, constructing a diverse
        portfolio of projects that showcased my capabilities. By combining
        theoretical insights with hands-on experience, I solidified my expertise
        in web development. I am now adept at creating dynamic and visually
        appealing websites, driven by a blend of creativity and technical
        proficiency. I am eager to leverage my skills and passion for web
        development to contribute effectively to your team and contribute to
        meaningful projects.
