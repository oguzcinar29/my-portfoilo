        I'm OÄŸuz, an electrical engineering student turned passionate
        programmer. Starting with C and C++, I found my calling in web
        development during university. I left formal education to focus on web
        development, diving into self-learning through Udemy courses and
        certifications. Building a robust portfolio, I honed my skills in
        creating dynamic and visually appealing websites.
